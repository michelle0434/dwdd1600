        <h1>Are you also a consumer of all media?</h1>
    <p>As a person who is a consumer of all media i have time and time again found individuals like me. But, some tend to be pretentious and overly opinionated in a rude way, and boy oh boy do i have opinions BUT im not an a**hole about it!! So ive created this website to share my thoughts and also make a space for people to digest my reviews and hopefully give them a different perspective on things. I also would love for anyone to share their own thoughts and also express their opinons. This space will be like a socratic seminar online!! Something about a socratic seminar in english class brings back so many good memories. I just enjoy an intelligent and sophisticated conversation/debate.</p>


    <h2>Why this is a safe space for us:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone here is required to respect everyones opinions and if not they will be <strong>reported</strong> and <strong>blocked.</strong>
            </li>
            
            <li>Ive curated this website to be something like a mixture of letterboxed, pinterest, reddit, and discogs.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Why sharing your thoughts and opinions is so important.</h2>
        <p>Sharing your opinions as a <em>heavy</em> media consumer is like being the taste tester in a kingdom full of hungry citizens. Your insights guide the masses through the labyrinth of content, helping them dodge the duds and discover the gems. Plus, your unique perspectives can spark conversations, challenge norms, and even influence the creators themselves. So, whether you're dissecting the latest plot twist or critiquing a groundbreaking documentary, remember: your voice adds color to the media tapestry and keeps the world a little more vibrant and informed.</p>
